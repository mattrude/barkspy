- question: How is this app different from other dog monitoring apps?
  answer: BarkSpy is designed as a tool for you to work on your dog's barking behavior. It is not a "magic bullet" - you still need to put in time and effort into training your dog; however, BarkSpy makes it easier to do by automating and corretly timing two most important tasks - positive and negative reinforcement. Another significant advantage of BarkSpy is that it is designed to work on very low-cost devices. So, if you don't want to leave your tablet or smart phone at home, you just need to buy a cheap Android-based device that runs OS version 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or later versions and dedicate this device to monitoring your pet.
- question: Can I watch my dog remotely?
  answer: BarkSpy is designed without remote monitoring capabilites on purpose. Your privacy is extremely important to us and remote video and audio surveilance carries a significant risk of violating privacy.
- question: BarkSpy is asking for access to all sort of things on my device. Why does it need that?
  answer: BarkSpy needs access to the following resources for normal operation&#58; video camera, microphone, internal and external storage. It also needs to be able to modify audio and video settings. All of these permissions are necessary for BarkSpy to be able to record sound and video and to store it on your device for subsequent review by you. BarkSpy does NOT communicate with any servers outside of the monitoring device and does NOT transmit any sound or images over the Internet. BarkSpy can function without Internet connectivity altogether, in case you wish to disable Wi-Fi on your monitoring device after BarkSpy is installed for added security. The only BarkSpy functionality that will not work in this case is the Help Menu because BarkSpy manual is stored online only. You can still access the manual, if you wish, by visiting this website from another device.
- question: How much will this whole set up cost me?
  answer: The cost to set up BarkSpy monitoring in your home will depend on what you already have availble. Look at <a href="/getthese">Get These</a> page for a list of required components. You can spend as little as $1.99 (cost of the app) if you already have a compatible Android device (smart phone, tablet, etc.) and good speakers that you can connect to the device. If you don't have any of the requred components, you can anticipate spending about $30 for the Android device, $20 for the speakers and $1.99 for the app - about $52 total. Obviousely, higher-end components can cost significantly more, but would not be required for adeqate performace of BarkSpy app.
- question: How long can I be away and monitor my dog with BarkSpy?
  answer: The maximum amount of time that BarkSpy can keep monitoring is only limited by the amount of avialbale space on the Android device. The devices recommended here <a href="/getthese">Get These</a> will have about 1 Gb of free space - enough for about 20-30 hours of monitoring with both video and audio recording turned on. If you store other media (photos, videos, etc.) on this device, that will reduce the amout of space availble to BarkSpy and will reduce the amount of monitoring time. You can significantly increase the amount of availble monitoring time, if you don't record video. To do this, simply check the &quot;Don&#39;t record video&quot; check box.<br />When first starting out using BarkSpy, we strongly recommend shorter monitoring periods - 30 mins - 1 hour. You can increase the monotoring time gradually once you are confident that your dog is responding to the propmpts appropriately. WARNING! We do NOT recommend leaving your dog alone with or without monitoring for longer than 8 hours!
- question: How can I get technical support for BarkSpy?
  answer: At this time, we are not able to provide direct technical support. If you have questions or comments, you can direct them to the address on the Contact page. While we will not be able to respond to you directly, we will do our best to include your question on the FAQ page and incorporate your suggestions into the next release of BarkSpy.
- question: How do I figure out the noise threshold?
  answer: The honest answer is "by trial and error." The right threshold depends on many factors that are unique to your dog and environment. These include how loud your dog is, how far the monitoring device is from the dog, how loud the ambient noise is. If your dog barks on command, you could try to have your dog bark with various settings to find the lowest setting that will trigger a voice response. If your dog does not bark on command, it would be a good idea to teach your dog to do that as learning to bark on command may actually help with the barking problem when you are away. In the meantime, you can try to simulate barking by clapping your hands at various distances from the monitoring device.
- question: What is the optimal "silence length threshold"?
  answer: Depends on your dog. If he/she barks a lot, it may be good to set the time between positive prompts to a smaller value - let's say 1 minute - and then work on increasing that gradually as the dog barks less and less to about 10-15 minutes.
- question: My app stopped responding or quit unexpectedly. What should I do?
  answer: You can try to restart the app first. If that does not fix the problem, restart the device.
- question: Will BARKSPY work on an iPhone?
  answer: Not yet. Currently it works only on Android devices.
- question: How do I know if this will work on my dog?
  answer: The best way is to test it out using the free 60 minute trial version. What we found with our dog is that he was fine initially when we left the house - but then after a bit he would realize that he was alone and then the barking would start. This would be the ideal situation to use this app with. You could also test out your dogs reaction to your recorded voice - try recording your voice and see if your dog reacts - looks toward the sound, turns head or perks ears up. TIP&#58; It's best to do this over better speakers than just a laptop/tablet/phone - our dog did not react to our recorded voice until we hooked up better (>$20) speakers.
- question: My dog doesn't bark, but is anxious (paces, chews things, panting heavily when we arrive home) when we are gone - would BarkSpy help my dog's anxiety even though there's not much barking?
  answer: Maybe. BarkSpy may not work magically for every dog - it's a good bet that barking is just one outward sign of anxiety. BarkSpy may work to lower your dog's anxiety by reassuring your dog that you are still there - even though you are not. This reassurance may lower their baseline of anxiety so they can be happier when you are away. It's worth a shot!
