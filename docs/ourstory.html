                                        Our sweet dog Bear was only 10 weeks old when we saw he was the only puppy in the litter seriously interested in humans – disinterested in toys and only mildly amused by his littermates. Fast forward a year or so after all the requisite dog training classes and we had a fabulous sweet dog in every way – BUT one HUGE problem – he would bark CONTINUOUSLY when we left the house.   Bear barked constantly because he could not defend his pack if he didn't know where his pack was.

                                        For 11 years we tried EVERYTHING – exercising/running him ragged, toys, stuffed treat toys, crating/not crating, hiring a dog walker, leaving him at home with another dog, citronella-spray collar and yes, sadly, we finally did try a bark collar. We spent tons of $$ over the years.  Nothing worked and we were constantly worried about our little Bear – totally stressed out by our absence.  Our lifestyle was entirely determined by our dog – really only going places we could take our dog.   Our neighbors were subject to nearly constant barking when we left the house for more than an hour or two.  After 11 stressful years, we started to understand why owners would begin to consider bark-softening surgery.

                                        Thankfully, we came up with an idea for remotely monitoring Bear using a computer – and like a miracle – he bought it IMMEDIATLEY!!! We went from constant barking to zero to three barks over an 8-hour period!  Even though we are off gallivanting around town, he THINKS we are home with him in the next room.  This clever app uses positive and corrective audio feedback humanely. We made the app super user-friendly and now can share with all the other dog owners struggling with this same problem.

                                        BarkSpy is a miracle for our dog – and hopefully will be for yours also!
